        <h2>Who is A.E.I.O.U.?</h2>
        <p> We are a group of educators working together for the purposes of creating a foundation of
            literacy for daycare centers and school age programs. We help children increase their basic
            literacy skills from the beginning of their preschool or daycare experience into Kindergarten
            and beyond. We are educators dedicated to helping children with basic literacy and computer skills.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p> Our mission is to work with children in low income areas to teach them how to use educational
            technology devices i.e. tablets and laptop computers in order to bridge the digital divide. We
            increase early literacy skills by using phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension
            and fluency in order to close the lireacy gap.
        </p>
