        <h2>Who is A.E.I.O.U.?</h2>
        <p> We are a group of educators working together for the purposes of creating a foundation of
            literacy for daycare centers and school age programs. We help children increase their basic
            literacy skills from the beginning of their preschool or daycare experience into Kindergarten
            and beyond. We are educators dedicated to helping children with basic literacy and computer skills.
