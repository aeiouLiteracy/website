        <h2>What is A.E.I.O.U?</h2>
        <p> A.E.I.O.U stands for African Empowerment Intelligence Organization For Unity.
            We are educators who work within educational organizations dedicated and motivated to help
            children with their literacy and computer skills. We encourage children on becoming literate
            from the beginning of their formal education into adulthood.
        </p>
        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p> Our mission is to promote technology and reading literacy to low income areas, daycare centers,
            preschools, head start programs, and school age programs. A.E.I.O.U.â€™s main focus is to close the
            literacy gap and to bridge the digital divide through our technology services for students.

          <h2>Little Children Learning To Love Literacy</h2>
          <p> One of the services A.E.I.O.U provides for students is our Little Children Learning To Love Literacy
              program (L.C.L.L.L). Within this program we focus on teaching the following literacy strategies
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reading Literacy</li>
            <li>Phonics</li>
            <li>Comprehension</li>
            <li>Decoding</li>
            <li>Buddy Reading</li>
            <li>Independent Reading</li>
            <li>Hands-On-Activities</li>
            <li>Small Group Instructions</li>
          </ul>
          <p> In addition to the literacy strategies, the L.C.L.L.L program also helps students with their technology
              literacy. Here we go very in depth in teaching students how to use computers and tablet devices with the
              assumption of no prior experience. From there, we then teach students how to use educational programs
              through these technologies.
