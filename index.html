      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p> Our mission is to work with children in a variety of economic based communites to teach them how to use educational
          technology devices i.e. tablets and laptop computers in order to bridge the digital divide. We
          increase early literacy skills by using phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, comprehension
          and fluency in order to close the literacy gap.
      </p>
      <h2>Educational Philosophy</h2>
      <p> The A.E.I.O.U. educational philosophy begins with helping children to realize their creativity, self awareness and motivation
          to become inspired, organized, and structured individuals. We believe if children are shown they have talents and are allowed
          the right to express them, children will have an increased skill set that will be useful in the future. These skills such as
          accessory knowledge (i.e. tablets, laptops, and touchscreens devices), in addition to the basic components of literacy.
      </p>
      <p> Children should be motivated to explore, dream and be challenged. They should also be taught to realize their dreams. The goal
          of A.E.I.O.U. is to help children find themselves and discover new things about who they are while promoting literacy skills.
